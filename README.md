# COVID-Data-Analysis-Project

We obtained this dataset from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths but there were some changes to the data since then so might be different from the one you will be seeing here

It contains 3 steps:

1.- SQL Data Exploration
2.- SQL Data Cleaning
3.- Visualization using Tableau
4.- Python Correlation

You can see the visualization dashboard here https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alejandro.clark/viz/COVIDAnalysis_16724639469220/Dashboard1
